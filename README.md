**HTML Setup:**

1. Create a new Rails app (`odin-kittens`), Git repo, and update the README.

2. Generate a Kitten model with `name`, `age`, `cuteness`, and `softness` attributes.

3. Create a KittensController with routes for all 7 RESTful actions.

4. Set `kittens#index` as the root route and build basic HTML views for all actions.

5. Add delete links and flash messages for success/error handling.

6. Test all controller actions.

**JSON API Setup:**

1. Use `rest-client` to make requests to the app.

2. Modify `KittensController#index` to support `respond_to` for JSON.

3. Implement JSON response for the `show` action.

4. Test API responses using `RestClient`.
